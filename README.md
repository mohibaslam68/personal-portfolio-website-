# personal-portfolio-website-

I have created a Personal portfolio Website for a gym trainer. The goal of this Personal portfolio
Website is to create an online presence that demonstrates training offerings, client success
stories, and professional knowledge to gain the trust of new clients. Users can also register,
schedule sessions, and read educational blogs about diet and fitness. The website consists of 7
pages, including the Home page.
• About me page
• Booking page ( book a session)
• Registration page( become a member)
• Programs page
• Contact page
• Blog page
